# testing
This reposotiry has pretty much no purpose, but for me to test in, If you want, you can too! When you are on the page (linked in the README file) right click and hit inspect. You can right click again and hit "Edit with HTML" remove all the code, and insert your own. This will have one line of code to make it easy to remove.
